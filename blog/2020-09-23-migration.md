Super exciting! We have been working on getting the newest Docusaurus version running for GoMint's documentation, which is v2.

New features, new layouts and structuring as well as a pretty nice dark mode arise with the migration to Docusaurus v2.

**We hope you like it!** Happy documentation reading, folks!
