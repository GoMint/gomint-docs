## Downloading the API JARs

## Adding JARs to Eclipse

### Mac OS Instructions

Before adding the JAR files to your build path in Eclipse, it's best to place them
in the workspace folder that you are working with, in a designated folder for
dependencies, or somewhere it will not be moved or accidentally deleted.

1. To begin, create a new Java Project in Eclipse, or click the name of the project
in the project explorer if you have already created it.
2. Click ```File->Properties```
3. Select "Java Build Path" from the list on the left.
4. Select "Classpath" from the list in the panel.
5. Select the button titled "Add External Jars"
6. Navigate to the JAR using Finder and select it.

Once you have completed these steps, the API should be installed into your
classpath in Eclipse and ready to use for creating plugins.

## Accessing the Javadoc

The GoMint API Javadoc can be found [here](https://s.janmm14.de/gomint-javadoc).
While not every method and class has been documented, the majority have been with
brief explanations as to their functionality.
